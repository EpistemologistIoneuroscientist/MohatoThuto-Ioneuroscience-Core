Core codebase and research data for Ioneuroscience projects. 


**Core codebase and research data for Ioneuroscience projects.**

---

**Overview:**

This repository houses the core codebase and research data underpinning the Ioneuroscience initiative. It serves as the central hub for our efforts in exploring the intersection of epistemology, osteopathy, and ioneuroscience. Here, you'll find:

* **Research Data:** Datasets related to our studies on plant-based treatments, ecosystem interactions, and ioneuroscience principles.
* **Codebase:** Software and scripts used for data analysis, modeling, and development of innovative treatments.
* **Documentation:** Explanations of methodologies, experimental setups, and research findings.
* **Collaborative Tools:** Issue tracking, project boards, and discussion forums for team collaboration.

**Key Areas of Focus:**

* **Phytochemistry:** Investigating the chemical properties of plants and their potential therapeutic applications.
* **Ecosystem Health:** Exploring the relationship between ecosystems and human well-being.
* **Ioneuroscience:** Developing a deeper understanding of the role of ions in neurological function and health.
* **Epistemology:** examining the nature of knowledge, and how it relates to Ioneuroscience.
* **Osteopathy:** the application of Osteopathic principles to Ioneuroscience.
